      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer (to be).</p>
      <p>I've always had a passion to build something out of nothing so I guess I fit right in.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines. Life may have been a little difficult since it's a third-world country but I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>As much as I hate to admit it, I'm not an active person. I prefer the comfort of home, reading books, and a hot cup of chocolate. I do go for a walk/run to get away from my computer if I feel like I've been in front of it for too long.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Been here in Melbourne for 6 years now. I love it here but haven't gotten used to the weather.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love to code! When I'm coding, it gives me some sort of adrenaline that I can't explain.</p>
